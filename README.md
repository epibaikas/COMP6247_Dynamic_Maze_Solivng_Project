## Project description

This repository contains the source code for the COMP6247 Dynamic Maze Solving Project. Python file maze_solver.py
contains the developed code used for determining the shortest path the maze exit.

## Reward convergence

The following plot demonstrates the convergence of the total reward received by the agent after approximately
50 epochs of training.
